# Local LLM Server

This repository provisions a **dedicated Mac mini** as a **stable, reproducible local LLM host**.

It is designed for long-term maintenance: safe upgrades, explicit model management, and clear separation between **host provisioning (Ansible)** and **service deployment (Docker containers)**.

## Quick Start

1. **Review the architecture:**
   - Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for project principles and guardrails
   - Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design

2. **Set up your environment:**
   - Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Configure target host in `inventory/hosts.yml`
   - Review defaults in `group_vars/all.yml`

3. **Verify connectivity:**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbooks/verify.yml
   ```

4. **Provision the host:**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml --check  # Dry-run first
   ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml           # Apply
   ```

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Key Features

✅ **Idempotent** — Run playbooks repeatedly; always converges safely  
✅ **Version-pinned** — All components have explicit versions; no "latest" by default  
✅ **Safe by default** — No upgrades, no destructive actions unless explicitly enabled  
✅ **Clear separation** — Host provisioning, service deployment, and model management are independent  
✅ **GitOps-ready** — All state declared in version control; reproducible from git checkout  
✅ **Observable** — Health checks and verification tasks included  
✅ **Maintainable** — One role per subsystem; clear responsibilities  

## Configuration

All configuration is centralized in version control:

- **Global defaults:** `group_vars/all.yml`
- **Host overrides:** `group_vars/macmini.yml` (keep minimal)
- **Target host:** `inventory/hosts.yml`
- **Execution modes:** Variables in `group_vars/all.yml`
  - `enable_upgrades` — Opt-in upgrades for Homebrew, Docker, Ollama
  - `ollama_models_refresh` — Repull all declared models
  - `ollama_models_prune` — Remove unmanaged models (dangerous)
- **Models:** Declared in `ollama_models` list (single source of truth)

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for configuration details.

## Commands

Use the Makefile for common tasks:

```bash
make help              # Show all available commands
make lint              # Run ansible-lint and yamllint
make verify            # Test connectivity to target host
make check             # Dry-run provisioning (--check mode)
make provision         # Run provisioning (no upgrades)
make provision-upgrade # Run provisioning with upgrades enabled
make clean             # Clean Ansible cache
```

Or run playbooks directly:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/verify.yml
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml --check
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml -e enable_upgrades=true
```

## Design Principles

This project follows strict principles (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)):

1. **Idempotency (must):** All tasks safe to run repeatedly.
2. **Version pinning (must):** No implicit "latest" upgrades.
3. **Safe upgrades (must):** Explicit opt-in; include rollback procedures.
4. **Separation of concerns (must):** Each role has a clear, narrow responsibility.
5. **Explicit configuration (must):** All state declared in version control.
6. **Observability (should):** Health checks and clear error messages.

## Upgrade Policy

Upgrades are **intentional and controlled**:

1. Update version variable in `group_vars/all.yml`
2. Test in `--check` mode first
3. Apply with `enable_upgrades=true`
4. Verify with `playbooks/verify.yml`
5. Document changes and any breaking behavior

See [docs/UPGRADES.md](docs/UPGRADES.md) for detailed procedures per component.

## Security

- **Localhost-only by default** — No remote exposure without explicit configuration
- **No secrets in repo** — `.env` files and credentials are gitignored
- **SSH key-based auth** — Passwords not supported
- **Minimal elevation** — Use sudo sparingly; document why

## Supported Environments

- **Target:** macOS 12+, Mac mini or equivalent
- **Control node:** macOS, Linux, or WSL with Ansible 2.13+
- **SSH:** SSH keys required; password auth not supported
